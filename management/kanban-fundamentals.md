# Kanban
Moto: **Stop starting. Start finishing.**

 

## Fundamentals:
- Provides early and consistent value to the organization.
- Promotes collaboration and self-managed teams.
 

Created by Toyota in 1940s to:

- Visually understand workflow (work items).
- Easy identify bottlenecks in that workflow.
 

###  Kaban VS Waterfall
- Waterfall: you waste a huge amount of time to get a huge amount of value.
- Kanban (and, in general, agile processes): you get a huge amount of value by incremental iterations, in small steps.

 

### Four Basic Principles of Kanban (core of Kanban)
- Start with what you do now.
- Agree to pursue incremental change.
- Respect current process, roles, responsibilities, titles.
- Encourage acts of leadership at all levels.
 

### Visual aspect: the Kanban board.
It shows:
- Work item statuses.
- Bottlenecks throughout the project.
 

It's a pull work methodology: Any team member can pull the work with highest priority.

  

## :pushpin: Six General Practices of Kanban
1. Visualize the workflow.
1. Limit work in progress (WIP).
1. Manage flow.
1. Make policies explicit.
1. Implement feedback loops.
1. Collaborate for improvement, evolve experimentally.
 
 

## :pushpin: Key Metrics
1. Lead time
1. Cycle time
 

| Task created | Work started| Task live |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ------------- |
| Lead time  | Lead time | Lead time |
| | Cycle time | Cycle time |

 

## Statuses
Minimum set of statuses (to be adapted to your organization):
- To Do.
- Doing.
- Done.
 

## Swimlanes
Used to group up tasks together according to some criteria (priority, deparment).
 

## Steps to Get Started
1. Step 1: Visualize your work.
2. Step 2: Limit work in progress (WIP)
3. Step 3: Adapt, monitor, and improve.
 


### Kanban Setup Checklist
1. Determine Physical or digital Kanban board.
1. Create Kanban board.
1. Visualize your work (work units/user stories)
1. Create a team Working Agreement - Definition of Ready and Definition of Done.
1. Come up with explicit policies.
1. Define and assign WIP limits to Kanban columns.
1. Identify and discuss impediments or blockers that will prohibit the team's momentum forward.
1. Determine a cadence (repetition) of optional team meetings (retrospective, prioritization session, backlog grooming).
