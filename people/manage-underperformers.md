## Principles:
Every case of underperformance involves a human being. Remember that. ♥️

Every one of us is underperforming *all of the time*, baselined against some
standard. E.g. "You today" vs "You 2 years from now" is not a fair competition. ♥️

There should be minimal difference between managing someone from "under performing to performing" and "performing to overperforming" the principles of coaching, empathy, and internally motivated and aligned incentives should remain the
same. ♥️
Always be coaching.

I feel that managers spend too much time focused on *that* someone is underperming, and *what to do* about it.

We don't focus enough on *why* someone is underperforming, and *when* we noticed. Sooner is better. It gives more options. Deeply understanding the "why" is critical.

*Underperforming.
🤦🏿‍♂️

Underperming is something different.

As a manager, maybe the Why is:

* Expectations weren't clear (my fault)
* Poor onboarding process (my fault)
* Missed something in hiring (my fault)
* Non-inclusive team culture (my fault)
* The job changed (my fault)

Maybe the Why is:
* Employee's goals and dreams changed (no fault)
* Life event shifting focus (no fault)
* A true skill gap (or rate of skill acquisition gap) (no fault)

And sure, maybe the Why is:
* intentional underperformance
* intentional laziness

Without deeply understanding the "why" you are unlikely to be able to act effectively.

*When* you understand the why is critically important. Learning it a few months after hire, or project start, is better than learning it a few days before their performance review is due.

Sneaky tip: I hire some folks onto my team that previously had "Needs Improvement" as a performance rating. Then after some magical coaching from the wise and all knowing Oz (me!) they are able to return to being a high performer! Go me!

As you guessed, the *why* was situational

So now it should make sense why blocking transfers of any folk with low performance reviews, can overly impacts people more likely to face situational challenges. So I don't do it.

I take the extra time to learn the *why*.

So now let's get to the ones that most managers worry about:
* True skill gap / rate of skill acquisition gap
* Intentional underperformance
* Intentional "laziness."

Suppose you've identified an issue nice and early, well in advance of any performance review. What do you do?

Let's cover skill gap. If you've been coaching all along, and have established a culture of feedback and improvement, then you shift the focus of your coaching to explicitly cover these areas.

I talk about the gaps openly, and with examples. And we cover if the gap can be closed
It's not always due to ability or work ethic. One reason a gap might not be closable, is employee happiness.

Even if the ability to close the gap is there, it might be uncomfortable to maintain, or it might be incompatible with meaningful work for that employee.

If the gap is closeable, we make a plan together to close and *prove to ourselves* that it is closed. This isn't about other people. It works best if the employee believes that it's a gap that can and should be closed and sees value in it.

Internal motivation as much as possible Many times, we are able to identify and correct a behaviour or close a skill gap, and prove to ourselves that it is corrected /
closed *before it ever appears* in a performance review, or is identified by a peer.

Negative Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)!🙃

I put scare quotes around "lazy" because I don't think most people are lazy.

I think some folks may not be bought in to the mission, or may be burned out, or have a different concept of how much effort is required to perform at the highest levels, or what the expectations are.
Consider a lazy SWE, happy to land at Google right out of college. Their pull requests are sloppy with lots of trivial bugs,missing tests, and needing lots of feedback. Their design docs need a lot of help. And their calendar is all "coffee and avocado toast with friends"

Lazy!

If performance review is in 6 months, a manager might list them as "too new to rate." But by 12 months they are clearly "underperforming," not learning or improving fast enough, and their manager is asking for information on how to do a PIP.😐

And the "lazy underperformer" might be genuinely surprised that the team that had just days ago felt so helpful to them, including their TL and mentor, all "turned on them" at 12 month performance review time. 🙁

It's all bad.
If instead at month 1, the manager had started on the
👨🏿 Hey, I noticed your past few pull requests had 'Add tests.'
👨🏻 Yeah! The TL is so helpful! She always reminds me! LOL!
👨🏿 OK, she may not complain about it, but having to ask the same thing over erodes trust in your abilities

👨🏻 Eek! But I want the TL to have confidence in me!
👨🏿 And several times I've seen "Not idiomatic?" Do you have much experience with C++?
👨🏻 Nope, first time! School was Python.
👨🏿 No worries! There are great resources for getting really good at C++ here.
👨🏻 Sweet! I'm down!

No, this doesn't fix 100% of the "lazy" cases. But a lot of what we view as laziness, is us not helping people direct their learning, or see value in it.

It's really easy to see laziness in other people. So ironically, we are lazy in our diagnosis of who is lazy.
🙂🙃

Finally, for situations where there is an unclosable gap, I don't wait to have the conversation. I don't wait for arbitrary performance review calendar time boundaries either.

And if I've done my job correctly, it's not a surprise for anyone.

Performance review is the worst time to tell someone they are underperforming.

Just like a calculus final exam is a bad time to tell someone they don't understand calculus. As a professor, you had class hours, office hours, homework, quizzes, tutors, midterms, etc, to help them

A few provocative questions I ask my reports:

1) How many hours a week during work hours (not evenings and weekends) do you think are important to spend intentionally improving your skills?
2) What skills are most important for you to excel at your job?
3) Best way to sharpen?
