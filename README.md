# MyBoK

:wave::smiley: Welcome to my BoK ([Body of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_knowledge)), a personal repository I recently created for better organization of the concepts and ideas I usually gather around a technical topic or learned. 


This is just my notebook for learning and it's in an early status. Big things always have a first step.

I decided to make it public to share the knowledge with more people interested on **technical topics**. Hope you find this collection interesting and helpful, specially if you are new in the tech community. Sometimes is hard to select a few ideas from the internet.

No matter your expertise or experience, **feedback, new ideas and improvements are always welcome**.


Cheers,
Raquel.
