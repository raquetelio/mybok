# MyBoK

Welcome to my BoK :wave::smiley:  ([Body of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_knowledge)) a personal repository I recently created for better organization of the concepts and ideas I usually learn in my work or spare time. 

I decided to make it public to share the knowledge with more people interested on **technical topics**. 

Hope you find something interesting here or some nice discussion can be generated. No matter your expertise or experience, **feedback, new ideas and improvements are always welcome**.



Cheers,
Raquel.
