## The Gestalt Principles

_Source: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles#:~:text=There%20are%20six%20commonly%20recognized,(also%20known%20as%20pr%C3%A4gnanz)._


There are six commonly recognized Gestalt principles of perception: similarity, continuation, closure, proximity, figure/ground, and symmetry and order (also known as prägnanz).

### Similarity (also known as Invariance)
The human eye tends to build a relationship between similar elements within a design. Similarity can be achieved using basic elements such as shapes, colors, and size.

### Continuation
The human eye follows the paths, lines, and curves of a design, and prefers to see a continuous flow of visual elements rather than separated objects.

### Closure (also known as Reification)
The human eye prefers to see complete shapes. If the visual elements are not complete, the user can perceive a complete shape by filling in missing visual information.

### Proximity (also known as Emergence)
Simple shapes arranged together can create a more complex image.

### Figure/Ground (also known as Multi-stability)
The human eye isolates shapes from backgrounds.

### Symmetry and order
The design should be balanced and complete; otherwise, the user will spend time and effort trying to perceive an overall picture.


## Gestalt Principles – a Background

"Gestalt" is German for "unified whole". German psychologists Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Kohler created the Gestalt Principles in the 1920s.

They wanted to understand how people make sense of the confusing things they see and hear. **They identified a set of laws that address the natural compulsion to find order in disorder. According to this, the mind "informs" what the eye sees by perceiving a series of individual elements as a whole.**

Graphic designers quickly embraced Gestalt Principles, using them to create eye-catching designs with well-placed elements.


`` 
The whole is other than the sum of the parts.

—Kurt Koffka

Gestaltism's philosophy is not the same as Aristotle's saying, "the whole is greater than the sum of the parts." In Gestaltism, the whole is different and may even be completely unrelated to its parts.
