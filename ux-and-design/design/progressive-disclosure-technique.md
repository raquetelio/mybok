Progressive disclosure is an interaction design technique that displays only important actions or content by default, while making additional features or content easily accessible. 

The result is a more streamlined interface that helps to keep the userâ€™s attention focused by reducing clutter, confusion, and cognitive load. Anytime we use a dropdown, accordion, or toggle that reveals content that is hidden by default, we are utilizing progressive disclosure. This strategy is incredibly useful for simplifying designs because it enables us to defer less important actions, advanced features, or additional content to a secondary screen (like a dropdown, accordion, or content toggle).
