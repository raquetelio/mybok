# Fitts law

Fitts’ law states that the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. Thus, the longer the distance and the smaller the target’s size, the longer it takes.

In plain words:

**Big and near objects are easy to click.**
 Small and far objects are hard to click.
